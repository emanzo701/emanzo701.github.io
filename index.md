I am a computer science major at CSUF and I am planing to graduate in 2028

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

* Lab 12, part 1

 Lab 12 was my favorite because it was really cool to see how we could create an animated image by combining different colors. It was fun working on smoothly transitioning colors across the image, and seeing the final animated GIF come to life was really satisfying. The challenge of debugging and getting everything to work together was excitement.

* Lab 5

 Lab 5 was my favorite because it challenged me to think critically about real world scenarios, like parking regulations, and apply programming concepts to solve them. I enjoyed writing functions to handle specific street rules and learning how to validate and process user inputs effectively. 

* Lab 10

 Lab 10 was my favorite because it gave me the opportunity to work with real world data, organizing California county populations and calculating percentages based on that information. There were some challenges of using a 2D vector to store and search data efficiently, but it felt nice to see how all the functions came together to create a useful program.
